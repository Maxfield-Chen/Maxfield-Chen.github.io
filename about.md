My name is Maxfield Chen, I'm a Junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute of Technology studying to become a Computer Science Major. I love computer security and redsec nonsense, expect postings on the basic and arcane aspects of security.

One day I aspire to join Cicada 3301.

### More Information

Once ranked 2nd nationally in the American Bouldering Series, now I just climb when I'm not under some gun of schoolwork. Other hobbies include Kendo, Locksport and Lindy Hop Swing.
