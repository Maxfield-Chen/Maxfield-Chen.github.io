My name is Maxfield Chen, I'm a Junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute of Technology studying to become a Computer Science Major. I love computer security and redsec nonsense, expect postings on the basic and arcane aspects of exploitation. 

One day I aspire to join Cicada 3301.

### More Information

Once ranked 2nd nationally in the American Bouldering Series, avid member of the Locksport community. Find me on Freenode #crypto or #security and sometimes #lobsters.
